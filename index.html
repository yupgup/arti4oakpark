      <p>Oak Park has long-aspired to be a “free, open and inclusive community.” The Village Diversity Statement says, “We believe the best decisions are made when everyone is represented in decision-making and power is shared collectively…The Village of Oak Park commits itself to a future ensuring equal access, full participation in all of the Village’s institutions and programs, and equality of opportunity in all Village operating policies.…It is our intention that such principles will be a basis for policy and decision making in Oak Park.”</p>

      <p>While laudable and lofty these aspirations may be, without an effective implementation plan, they do not reflect the lived realities of a growing number of Oak Parkers. We have enormous assets and potential, yet the benefits are not evenly shared. The promise of an equitable and inclusive village will remain elusive unless we fight for it. Because when we fight for racial equity, everyone wins.</p>

      <section class="issue issue-education">
        <h3>Equitable Education</h3>
        <p>Arti believes that village institutions must work collaboratively across every level of education to ensure that all students have access to high-quality opportunities every step of the way, without bias or barriers. If elected, Arti will fight to have the village board work with our school districts to help enact and implement strong racial equity policies focused on comprehensive systems change. Our school systems must ensure that they are eliminating, rather than contributing to, opportunity gaps. This will require action to address systemic bias and disparities in key areas such as tracking and ability grouping, disciplinary practices, curriculum content, teacher diversity, and school climate. Arti also supports additional targeted strategies to support students most in need--such as expanded access to tutoring, after-school, and summer school programs.</p>

      <section class="issue issue-development">
        <h3>Equitable Development</h3>
        <p>Arti will work to ensure that the benefits and burdens of economic development-- such as new housing and business--are shared in an equitable manner. Development must be consistent with community values, comprehensive planning, public safety and a healthy and sustainable environment.  Economic development-related planning and decision-making must be conducted more transparently and democratically, where the public good is prioritized over private interests. Arti will fight to increase and incentivize woman- and minority-owned businesses, and small and local businesses. Village expenditures should also meet supplier diversity goals to ensure that we reach out to, and pursue business with all available vendors. The village must also provide balanced attention to Oak Park’s many business districts and neighborhoods. Supporting alternatives to conventional development subsidies by incentivizing community-based innovation and incubators, arts and cultural initiatives, co-ops, and other grassroots efforts that can contribute to a vibrant and growing economy are also vital to equitable development in Oak Park.</p>

      <section class="issue issue-housing">
        <h3>Equitable Housing</h3>
        <p>Arti believes that Oak Park must be accessible to people of all incomes. Arti supports increased efforts to make Oak Park’s housing affordable and integrated. Arti will support an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance that requires developers to contribute a designated percentage of investments to create affordable housing units in each development and to support village-wide access to affordable housing. Arti will also support efforts to promote racial integration by the Oak Park Housing Center, and fight against the recent budget cuts to the Regional Housing Center by the current Village Board. Arti also supports efforts to treat Oak Park’s homeless community with dignity, providing viable opportunities for permanent housing.</p>

      <section class="issue issue-governance">
        <h3>Equitable Governance</h3>
        <p>Arti believes that government processes and leadership must be inclusive of all community stakeholders in order to reflect and represent the full community. The village must adopt and implement a racial equity decision-making framework for planning, policy-making and budgeting, including public procurement and contracting.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="issue issue-taxation">
        <h3>Equitable Taxation</h3>
        <p>Arti will work across local government entities to keep increased property taxes from making Oak Park more unaffordable. The village must exercise frugality and stewardship with public resources to eliminate waste and maximize efficiencies, without compromising the quality of vital services. Arti will work to apply a racial equity framework to revenue generation, budgeting, and expenditures.</p>
